# TransversalExercise-TankProblem
A python coded numerical model that tries to prepare a model i.e. simplification of the reality; within step                    by step modifications in it. Here, to understand and to prepare a hydrological cycle model for a watershed.

                   watershed(Sugawara) we have considered a small tank which receives water and produces a discharge. 
                   The model develops through several steps with different number of variables at each step.
